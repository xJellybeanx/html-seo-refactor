# HTML SEO Refactor

## Description

This project a simple to use website that provides direct and easy to read inforamtion based on search engine optimization. It gave me the opportunity to put into work what I have learned in bootcamp. I was able to consolidate, rename divs, and fix a broken link in order to minimize space usage. From the experience I had a lot can be done to enhance the HTML page but also a lot can be ruined at the same time if the work is not done correctly.
